Why a Library Management System is necessary to Baguio Central University — aligned strictly with features implemented in BCULMS (cataloging, circulation, students, archiving, dashboards/reports, role-based authorization, and data analytics).

## Cataloging and Circulation
- 2024 — Research on the Design and Educational Application of Library Management System (SSM/MySQL)
  https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3670013.3670029
  Demonstrates LMS value in registering books, borrowing/return history, retrieval, and visualizing circulation — supports BCULMS catalog and borrow/return transactions.

- 2022 — Analysis of book circulation data and a book recommendation system in academic libraries
  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740818822000548
  Shows how circulation transaction data informs collection decisions and services — aligns with BCULMS `transaction_borrow` logging and copies’ availability tracking.

## Students (Borrowers) Management

  https://www.ala.org/news/2024/10/state-us-academic-libraries-findings-acrl-2023-annual-survey
  Emphasizes tracking circulation, collections, and staffing trends — aligns with BCULMS transaction histories and operational reporting.

## Authorization and Security (Role-Based Access)
- 2025 — NIST CSRC RBAC Library (archived project page)
  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/role-based-access-control/rbac-library
  Authoritative reference set on role-based access control — supports BCULMS Admin/Librarian role checks protecting critical operations (add/edit/archive/restore).

## Archiving and Collection Maintenance (Auditability)
- 2021 — The Research Audit Trail: Methodological Guidance for Application in Practice
  https://academic-publishing.org/index.php/ejbrm/article/view/2033
  Argues for maintained audit trails to ensure dependability and confirmability — relates to BCULMS archival tables and transaction histories for change traceability.

## Library Use and Student Success
- 2025 — The impact of library visits on undergraduate student GPA
  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0099133325000369
  Finds positive correlation between library visits and GPA — supports the institutional need for efficient circulation and transparent services tracked in BCULMS.
